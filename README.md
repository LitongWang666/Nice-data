# About me
Hello, it‚Äôs Qing (she/her/hers). Currently, I am a Public Policy and Management Student.
I love data journalism and will try to be a good story teller.
In another life, I would‚Äôve worked in a nature documentary crew or been an penguin üêß.

# What I hope to learn
I aim to master everything about data visualization, like a wizard learning spells.
My plan? To create my own projects. Picture this: transforming my month-long European escapade into a visual feast, mapping every espresso sipped and every city visited.

# Forbes Athlete Salary Level Analysis
litongwang Tableau
# Introduction to Visualization
This is a Forbes list of all types of athletes that visualizes the salary data of all athletes. We compare salaries online and offline. 

Here is a link to our raw data: https://data.world/makeovermonday/the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes-in-2023
# What we did
We have used bar charts to visualize this data and we have tried to show the athletes on-field salary and off-field salary in two bar charts respectively. Additionally, we used color to show the difference in total salaries, with the higher salary bar being darker in color and vice versa.
