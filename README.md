# Data-Viz
My portfolio page for Telling Story with Data at CMU :)

# About me
Hello, it’s Qing (she/her/hers). Currently, I am a Public Policy and Management Student.
I love data journalism and will try to be a good story teller.
In another life, I would’ve worked in a nature documentary crew or been an penguin 🐧.

# What I hope to learn
I aim to master everything about data visualization, like a wizard learning spells.
My plan? To create my own projects. Picture this: transforming my month-long European escapade into a visual feast, mapping every espresso sipped and every city visited.

# Portfolio
Here’s the roadmap of my journey to becoming a cool data storyteller.
